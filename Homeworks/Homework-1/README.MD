## Introduction

Welcome to the Java Concepts repository! This repository explores essential Java concepts and best practices. Below, you'll find links to detailed Medium articles covering specific topics.

## Referans ve Değer Tipleri

**[Java'da Referans ve Değer Tipleri](https://medium.com/@ahmet_yigit_02/javada-referans-ve-de%C4%9Fer-tipleri-is-that-pointer-a369b409c733)**

This article delves into the distinction between reference and value types in Java, providing insights into their behavior and usage.

## Java Interface

**[Java Interface](https://medium.com/@ahmet_yigit_02/java-interface-634ca9f5d79e)**

Explore the power of Java interfaces in this article. It covers syntax, declaration, interface methods, and practical use cases, including design patterns.

## Code Implementation

This repository contains two versions of code implementation:

### First Part - Using Separate DAOs for Each Entity

Explore a design where each entity has its own Data Access Object (DAO). This can lead to a modular and organized codebase.

### Second Part - Using One Interface to Create DAOs

Discover an alternative approach using a single interface to create Data Access Objects. This can simplify code structure and maintenance.

Feel free to explore each part's code in the corresponding directories.

## Contribution

If you find issues or have suggestions, feel free to contribute by opening an issue or a pull request.

Happy coding!
